== Background

While the Apache Foundation has its own Unpackager (link:https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-commons/nifi-flowfile-packager/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/util/Unpackage.java[nifi-flowfile-packager]). It lacks a packager, and dumps all attributes into their own text files which is a little messy for large projects.

I've developed several versions of this project over the years, and created a WebGUI based version: link:https://www.nf2t.net/[].

== How to Build

* Run the link:./update.sh[] script to update the versions of the project.
* Run the link:./build.sh[] to build the project and get the maven.zip file to upload to Maven Central Repository.

== Example Scripts
* link:./download_jar.sh[Download the JAR from MAVEN]

== TODO

* link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/docinfo/#head[]
* Add GitHub Specific sauce
* Remove progress bars from maven.
* See link:https://github.com/remkop/picocli/tree/main/picocli-codegen#generate-documentation[]
* FileSystem or InputStreams to parse?
* Review the standard implementation, make sure this implementation is as similiar as possible: link:https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-commons/nifi-flowfile-packager/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/util/Unpackage.java[].
* Always say unpackage before package reflecting its primacy.
